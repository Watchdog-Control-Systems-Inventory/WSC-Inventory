If you’re linking to an Amazon product:
Copy the ASIN from the URL — it’s the 10-character code after /dp/.
Example: (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC5P8NC2?)

2. Update the HTML Redirect Code
Each HTML file in this repo automatically redirects to the supplier’s page.
Open the file and replace the existing link with the new one.
